# Interactive console

Run `npm run demo` after the README environment setup. The browser uses the same-origin `/v1` HTTP API. All request amounts are decimal strings in minor units; display uses the provisioned asset scale. USD and EUR use scale 2 and separate default ledgers. There is no implicit FX conversion. **Demo UI limitation:** the interface assumes one currency per ledger and does not support mixed-currency accounts within a ledger. This is a demo constraint, not a library restriction.

## Workspace

- **Overview:** five editable guided scenarios and wallet balances.
- **Accounts:** full paginated account directory, normal side, overdraft policy, grant capability, posted/reserved/available balances; create accounts and ledgers.
- **Transactions:** transfer form with a persistent reference, marketplace fee split, funding, atomic bulk and rollback, reversal/correction, backdated posting, and deliberate invariant failures. Select a transaction to inspect its entries, metadata, accounting/creation timestamps and related transaction ID.
- **Holds:** paginated reservations, selection, partial capture, capture remainder and void. Each new capture requires a new reference; an exact replay uses its original reference and amount.
- **Credits:** grants, short-lived grants, consumption, holds, partial unspent refunds, untouched-grant reversal, expiration preview/run, grant/transaction allocation lineage, credit balance and lot directory. IDs returned by writes populate subsequent templates.
- **Reconciliation:** editable matching rules, multiple external records or CSV import, dry run, persisted run, result filtering and audited debit/credit adjustments. The supported strategy is `one_to_one`. A rule's criteria are conjunctive; multiple rules are alternatives.
- **Reports:** historical balance, balance events, account statement, credit statement and trial balance. Edit fixed ISO time boundaries and use Next page without changing scope/filters.
- **API docs link:** opens locally bundled Swagger UI in a separate tab, generated from the installed contract; endpoints grouped by resource, complete schemas, editable parameters, and Try it out using the active sandbox token. Raw `/openapi.yaml` remains byte-identical to the package. The presentation JSON only adds tags and a same-origin server URL.

Operation workbench requests are editable before sending. Click **Regenerate with new reference** for a distinct posting; use **Repeat exact request** to test idempotency. Errors use the real transport/domain code and status. Failed requests stay in the journal. No synthetic success responses are generated.

The journal retains the latest 150 requests in this tab, from console operations. It redacts token/key values, shows HTTP status, response, timing and `x-request-id`, and copies POSIX-safe cURL using `$ACCESS_TOKEN`. Obtain an external token with `POST /v1/auth/token` and `x-api-key`; the private sandbox uses separate host provisioning and never reveals a bootstrap ADMIN key.

## Guided flows

1. **Wallet:** fund → transfer → insufficient funds. Repeat the transfer before advancing to see 201 vs 200; change amount without changing reference to see payload mismatch.
2. **Marketplace:** buyer debit 25.00 → seller credit 23.00 + fee credit 2.00 → reversal → separate payment → atomic correction. Select another original transaction when exploring freely.
3. **Authorization & capture:** reserve 25.00 → capture 10.00 → void 15.00. Posted funds change only on capture; available funds reflect reservations.
4. **Prepaid credits:** issue a regular grant and a 15-second lot → reserve → consume → refund eligible capacity → void the reservation → preview/run expiration → inspect allocations. Wait until the short-lived lot expires, regenerate preview, then run with that preview's `as_of`. Future preview is permitted; future run returns an error. Run again for further bounded expiration pages until the due preview is empty.
5. **Finance:** create rule → upload matching and external-only records → dry run → persist report → inspect results → audited adjustment → rerun. Editing a mismatched reference/amount or adding competing candidates demonstrates other result categories; a new run evaluates the same external upload against the current ledger.

## CSV and filters

CSV headers: `id,amount_minor,currency,reference,date` and optional `description`. Quoted commas, escaped quotes, CRLF and UTF-8 BOM are supported. Import accepts 1–1000 rows, up to 1 MB, validates positive integer amounts and timestamps, then converts locally to the documented JSON ingestion request. The API upload is not a multipart CSV endpoint.

Read panels accept endpoint-specific `where` JSON, for example `{"status":{"eq":"matched"}}` on reconciliation results. Use `eq`, `ne`, `in` and supported numeric/date comparisons only for documented fields. Metadata JSON paths and derived lot capacity are not filterable. The server validates unknown fields/operators; Next page preserves the exact filter and time boundaries. Every page has explicit completeness status.

## Host boundaries

`POST/GET /demo/session` handles private provisioning/token renewal. Session cookies are HttpOnly, SameSite=Strict, Secure behind HTTPS; financial access is SERVICE-only, tenant-scoped and expires after eight hours. `New sandbox` replaces only this session. Tabs in the same browser profile share the cookie; a stale tab's revoked token requires a new page load.

Library 0.5 has no hold list/get endpoint and no public asset provisioning endpoint. `/demo/session/holds` is a clearly labelled, tenant/ledger-scoped host read with pagination; mutations use `/v1/holds`. Assets are provisioned with public application services by the host. This demo does not add undocumented library routes or change core invariants.

The legacy shared `/demo/state` and financial wrapper routes are available only outside production, for compatibility tests. Their global reset is not invoked by the console. New financial flows never depend on those wrappers. Expired sandbox histories remain in the dedicated database; see the operations runbook for maintenance.
